<h3>Into the "Genetic Algorithm"</h3>

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm" target="_blank">Genetic Algorithm (GA)</a> is a method for solving constrained and unconstrained optimization problems based on Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection, which mimics biological evolution by John Henry Holland in the 1970s.

<h2 id="objectiveFunction">How to define objective function</h2>
<p>An objective function is to determine to return a minimum value from the f(x)
<br>
In case you need to find a maximum value, You must define the objective value as 1/f(x)
<br><br>
To define an objective function can define at <a href="https://github.com/Rayato159/Genetic_Algorithm_Open_Source/blob/main/objective.py" target="_blank">objective.py<a> as an example
<br></p>

```python
def function(self, x):
  # x[0] x[1] are x and y respectively. (If you have N parameters you can customize it as you want.)
  return (x[0]**2 + x[1] - 11)**2 + (x[0] + x[1]**2 - 7)**2
```

<strong>Note that. parameter x must be listed.</strong>
<p>If your objective function is complicated don't worry you can define it as you want but the function must return a value in one dimension.
For more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization" target="_blank">test function</a></p>
<br>
<p>Next step you need to determine the result function to return the parameters that pass into the objective function as an example</p>

```python
def result(self, x):
  # x[0] x[1] are x and y respectively. (If you have N parameters you can customize it as you want.)
  return (x[0], x[1])
```

<strong>Note that. the return value of the result function must be tuple.</strong>

<h2 id="constraints">How to define constraints</h2>
<p>To determine the constraints you must do at <a href="https://github.com/Rayato159/Genetic_Algorithm_Open_Source/blob/main/genetic_algorithm.py" target="_blank">genetic_algorithm.py</a>. You must define a constraint for 2 place, first at <a href="https://github.com/Rayato159/Genetic_Algorithm_Open_Source/blob/main/genetic_algorithm.py#L47" target="_blank">line 47</a> second at <a href="https://github.com/Rayato159/Genetic_Algorithm_Open_Source/blob/main/genetic_algorithm.py#L163" target="_blank">line 163</a> as the same constrains.
If no constraints you can replace as <strong>True</strong> in "if" logic.<br>

For exmaple (constraints are required)</p>

```python
# Line 47
# rand_param[] are returned by result function
if(
      rand_param[0] > 0
  and rand_param[1] > 0
):

# Line 163
# decode_1[] and decode_2[] are returned by result function
if(
      decode_1[0] > 0
  and decode_1[1] > 0
  and decode_2[0] > 0
  and decode_2[1] > 0
):
```
<p>To describe, I want to random an input parameter of more than 0. Therefore, I need to build constraints for the first generation and build constraints for chlid_1 and chlid_2.
That is why I am defining the same constraints for decode_1 and decode_2.</p>

For exmaple (constraints are not required)</p>

```python
# Line 47
if(
  True
):

# Line 163
if(
  True
):
```
<h2 id="main">How to define use <a href="https://github.com/Rayato159/Genetic_Algorithm_Open_Source/blob/main/main.py" target="_blank">main.py</a></h2>
<p>This step is the last step before run the algorithm. You must define lower bounds, upper bounds and hyperparameters as you want.<br>
For example</p>

```python
# Use for run GA

# Define lower bounds here
lower_bounds = [
    -5,
    -5
]

# Define upper bounds here
upper_bounds = [
    5,
    5
]

genetic = GA(
    parameters_num=len(lower_bounds),
    bits=16,
    population_num=100, 
    generation=100, 
    crossover_prob=0.95, # percent 
    mutation_prob=0.03,  # percent
    k=3,                 # the random number for pick random parents
    lower_bounds=lower_bounds,
    upper_bounds=upper_bounds
)

solution = genetic.run()
```

<p>If all of the above steps are finished you can use this command to run the algorithm. (Don't forget to cd into a working directory.)</p>

```bash
python main.py
```
